# File Uploader

Created by Harshit Sharma (Nickname: HarshitEthic), Website: [harshitethic.in](https://harshitethic.in)

## Description

This is a simple file uploader script created using PHP and AJAX. The script allows users to upload files either by selecting a file from their local machine or by providing a URL. The files are stored in an "uploads" folder on the server. The code also includes a basic admin login system to protect the uploader from unauthorized access.

## Setup

1. Create a folder named "uploads" in the same directory as the PHP script. This folder will be used to store the uploaded files.
2. Clone the repository using the following command: `git clone https://github.com/harshitethic/file-uploader`
3. Run the script on your local server or hosting provider with PHP support.

## Features

- Admin login to protect the uploader from unauthorized access.
- Upload files using a file input or by providing a URL.
- Progress bar to display the upload progress.
- Success pop-up message after the file is uploaded successfully.
- Header and footer with a similar design to Twitter's header and footer.
